                <p>MSN (Messi, Suárez, Neymar) was one of the most iconic attacking trios in football history, representing FC Barcelona from 2014 to 2017. Their exceptional chemistry, individual brilliance, and collective dominance helped Barcelona achieve remarkable success during this period. In the 2014/15 season, MSN led Barcelona to a historic treble, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. Together, they scored 122 goals that season, showcasing their unmatched synergy. Over their three seasons, the trio netted a total of 364 goals, breaking multiple records, including 131 goals in the 2015/16 campaign. Some of their most memorable moments include the legendary "Remontada" against PSG in 2017, where Neymar's heroic performance turned a 4-0 first-leg deficit into a 6-1 aggregate victory, and their dominance in El Clásico matches against Real Madrid. The MSN era ended in 2017 when Neymar transferred to PSG for a world-record fee, but their legacy as one of football's greatest attacking units remains unparalleled.</p>
